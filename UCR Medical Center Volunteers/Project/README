Case 2 UCR Medical Center Volunteers - Program to calculate and display probability. The purpose of the program is to calculate
the probability of the student being assigned a certain country for the volunteer program. By prompting the user to select their
specialization followed by the language they are fluent in. Also allowing the user to input their preferred Country based 
on their language selection the program generates a random country of their matched language and if the country matches with their
preferred country it displays the probability of being assigned that country. If they do not match it displays the probability of
both the random matched country and their preferred one.
