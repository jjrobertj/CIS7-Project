Program project to perform a Vigenere Cipher Decryption & Encryption. The purpose of the program is to prompt the user to enter a simple text and to encrypt the text using a keyword given by the user that will substitute the letters and encrypt it. And it will also decrypt the encrypted text, by performing the same function as encryption but backwards. 
When the program is run, the user will be prompted to enter text DISCLAMIER: TRIED TO INTERGRATE THE ABILITY TO ADD SPACE BETWEEN TEXT BUT COULD NOT MAKE IT WORK, THEREFORE THE SPACE IS CALCULATED AS THE LETTER "T". Once the user enters text, the user will be prompted to enter a keyword that will be used to encrypting the text that was previously provided. After these two prompts are finished, the user will be provided the key for the text, the encrypted text, and to reassure that it was done correctly, the decrypted text.
