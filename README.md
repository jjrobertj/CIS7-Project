Case 3: Vigenere Cipher -
Program project to perform a Vigenere Cipher Decryption & Encryption. The purpose of the program is to prompt the user to enter a simple text and to encrypt the text using a keyword given by the user that will substitute the letters and encrypt it. And it will also decrypt the encrypted text, by performing the same function as encryption but backwards. 
When the program is run, the user will be prompted to enter text DISCLAMIER: TRIED TO INTERGRATE THE ABILITY TO ADD SPACE BETWEEN TEXT BUT COULD NOT MAKE IT WORK, THEREFORE THE SPACE IS CALCULATED AS THE LETTER "T". Once the user enters text, the user will be prompted to enter a keyword that will be used to encrypting the text that was previously provided. After these two prompts are finished, the user will be provided the key for the text, the encrypted text, and to reassure that it was done correctly, the decrypted text. 

Case 2 UCR Medical Center Volunteers - Program to calculate and display probability. The purpose of the program is to calculate
the probability of the student being assigned a certain country for the volunteer program. By prompting the user to select their
specialization followed by the language they are fluent in. Also allowing the user to input their preferred Country based 
on their language selection the program generates a random country of their matched language and if the country matches with their
preferred country it displays the probability of being assigned that country. If they do not match it displays the probability of
both the random matched country and their preferred one.
